// all of the rust code has to be run inside the `main` function.

// so rust has this cool feature where you don't really have to decalre the type of the variable
// but just to be clear, you should always do that.
// another thing is that rust throws warnings if a variable is not used, to avoid such warnings, add #[allow(unused_variables)] in the start of the file
// another way we can do this is by naming the variable in this format -> _varname. adding an
// underscore tells the compiler that it should ignore this unused variable.
//
// by default, rust doesn't allow a variable to be mutable. for it to have changing values one has
// to mention it as `mut` at the time of declaration.
